Introduction:
  Heaps are another binary Tree
  Each node has to have some comparable value
  Think of each of these valaues as a priority
    Max on top
  Is always balanced as each node is put in via breath order
  Each node is comparable to its parent
  Either greater than or less than depending on type of heap
Min heap
  1->(2->(17->(25,100),19),3->(36,7))
Max Heap
  100->(19->(17->(2,7),3),36->(25,1))
