Objects for class

Player
  -health : int
  +UserInput() : void
  +Render() : void
  +Update() : void

ExplodingBarrel
  -health : int
  +Render() : void
  +Update() : void

Doesn't work, Player is not an instance of ExplodingBarrel

Game Engine -> Has many Game Objects -> Has many Game Components
More polymorphism
Aggregate based
